# Titanic_Spaceship

## Introduction
The Spaceship Titanic project is a comprehensive machine learning and data analysis workflow designed to predict passenger outcomes on the fictional Spaceship Titanic. Leveraging Python, advanced libraries like CatBoost, and Jupyter Notebooks, this project provides insights into predictive modeling, data preprocessing, and visualization.

## Project Overview
The project is based on a Kaggle competition where the goal is to predict the survival status of passengers aboard the Spaceship Titanic. **This solution achieved an impressive rank of 30th in the Kaggle competition.** The dataset includes demographic, journey, and survival data for individuals traveling across space.

Key objectives of this project:
- Explore the dataset and perform feature engineering.
- Build predictive models using machine learning techniques.
- Evaluate model performance and optimize results.

## Server Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8+
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, catboost, flask (for the web application)

## Features
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook**: An end-to-end walkthrough of data exploration, cleaning, and model building.
- **Web Application**: Built with Flask (`app.py`) to deploy the prediction model.
- **Machine Learning Models**: CatBoost, Random Forest, and other algorithms for classification.
- **Data Visualization**: Insights through plots and graphs.
- **Comprehensive Dataset Management**: Train and test datasets in CSV format.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Spaceship-Titanic.git
   cd Spaceship-Titanic

2.Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # For Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Start the Flask application:
    python app.py

4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access the application.

## Dataset
- ** Train Dataset: train (1).csv
- ** Test Dataset: test (1).csv
- ** Prediction Results: spaceship_prediction_project.csv

## Usage
For Analysis:

Open titanic-spaceship-competition-end-to-end-project.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Run the notebook cells sequentially to see data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
For Predictions:

Use the Flask web application to input passenger details and get predictions.
